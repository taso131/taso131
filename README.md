- ðŸ‘‹ Hey, there! Iâ€™m @taso131
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in exploits, data manipulation, networks, crypto and low level programming
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#, python and advanced linux system management (shell programming)
but I've also gathered quite a lot front-end experience. I'd consider myself more of a back-end guy though,
since I'm not really good with art but in logical thinking.
